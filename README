README

The folder DNA_coverage contains the processed data to plot the genomic read coverage (RPKM) for scaffolds 1 to 16.

The folder RNAseq_U_nigricaudus_coverage contains the processed data to plot the Males 1-2 and Females 1-2 RNAseq read coverage (RPKM) for scaffolds 1 to 16. Data come from tails of U_nigricaudus.

The folder RNAseq_U_bicarinatus_coverage contains the processed data to plot the tissue and scaffolds 1 to 16 RNAseq read coverage (RPKM). Data come from liver, kidney, heart, and brain U_bicarinatus.

The folder scripts contains the R scripts to plot the data.

The folder Genes_Xchr contains the gene identities for X-linked genes in U_nigricaudus.
